An analysis of a Megastore

# Description

This analysis includes visualizations that depict key findings, such as the highest-selling countries, lowest-selling countries, and a sales prediction for the upcoming years.

My most notable conclusion is that this store demonstrates strong sales performance in the United States compared to other countries. The disparity is substantial, suggesting that the store may not operate at the same global level as it does in the US.

I trained a ML to make the prediction with the sales numbers provided by the dataset.
